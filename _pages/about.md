I'll come up with something...

Ok... here's a thing... our family has a policy against posting pictures of our daughter online. She's only 9 years old. She has a right to privacy and to control her online identity, even if she doesn't completely understand it yet. The Internet is forever. As her parents, we do not have the right to violate her privacy or create a permanent public record of things she may not appreciate as an adult.

We decided before she was born that we would do our best not to share any pictures of her in public online spaces. Instead, we would wait until she was old enough to understand the implications and give us her consent. So, with few exceptions (a family photo here and there), that's why you won't find pictues of our daughter.
